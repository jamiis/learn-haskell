code samples from my journey into learning haskell!

note: I do not purport that this code is mine!
before an author--e.g. miran lipovaca, author of "learn you a haskell", who
is amazing and awesome and all things good--demonstrates how to write an
algorithm in haskell, I attempt to code it out myself. in the end, I refine my 
code to ensure it actually works properly, which often entails replacing portions 
of my buggy code with correct code from a solution written by someone else :)
